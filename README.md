wordfall
========

JavaScript/web development is a weakness of mine, and I need to learn more about it. So I'm going to be doing more learning projects in this space. wordfall is a very simple game I wrote, just type the words as they fall down your browser. It doesn't use canvas or anything, just some divs, spans, and jQuery.

I limited myself to the time I had on a flight to Florida for this project. I'll admit I cheated and worked on it a bit after we landed, but we had our four-month-old on the flight so I think it evens out.
